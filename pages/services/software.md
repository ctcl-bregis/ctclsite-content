### Language Experience
I have started to learn about software development and programming in late 2021 in order to start working on [CAMS](/projects/cams/). Prior to this, I had extensive experience with Scratch and minimal experience with Python.

Currently, I use Python for most tasks. Sometimes I use Rust or C in applications where high performance and low resource usage is required.

### Web Design
I have extensive experience in developing and maintaining web applications and websites. I can design and develop websites and web software of varying complexities by hand, with web frameworks or with web editors.

This entire website is designed, developed and maintained by myself, currently using [StaticSite](/project/staticsite/).

#### Custom Solutions
These are web-related tools I have developed myself.

- [StaticSite](/projects/staticsite/) - Static site generator
- [Lysine](/projects/lysine/) - Templating language
- [Serine](/projects/serine/) - CSS preprocessor **Coming Soon**
