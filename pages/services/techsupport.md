### Small Business and Home Technology Support
I have experience in the management and setup of Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) environments from personal, educational and work experience.

### Server and Datacenter Management
I have extensive experience with datacenter server hardware with my employment at [2nd Life Inc.](https://2ndlifeinc.com/), [personal setups](/projects/pchardware/) and sessions at [VCU HPRC](https://research.vcu.edu/cores/hprc/facilities/). I have been using server hardware in home environments since 2020. At this point, I interact with server-grade hardware every day.

I have worked on server hardware from ASUS, HP(E), Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and Cisco in form factors including rack-mount, tower and blade being able to diagnose issues and identify parts of the system.

Along with hardware, I have extensive experience with Linux and FreeBSD in server environments.
