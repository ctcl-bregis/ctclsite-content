## Projects

### CAMS
For CAMS, I started to come up with a better plan for how I am going to write the software. The project has suffered in the past from the lack of planning with the immense perceived size of the project.

### ContactList
I started working on ContactList again for version 0.6.0. This update adds Bootstrap which required me to rewrite all of the HTML and styling.

### WBPC
On January 13, 2024, I finally installed another SSD into ["Polybutylene Terephthalate"](/projects/pc_pbt/). The system now has one SK hynix P41 1TB NVMe SSD and one Samsung PM9A1 512GB SSD. I ended up having to back up and reinstall both Windows 10 and Linux Mint. This event, however, let me update to the new Linux Mint 21.3 "Virginia" release.

### Website
I have been gradually adding more features and content to this website within the last couple weeks.

## Personal

### North Carolina
I had an interesting business trip this week to the Outer Banks area of North Carolina. I did not have to do any work related to it but it gave me time for working on personal projects in a different environment.
