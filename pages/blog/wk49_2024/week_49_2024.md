## Projects
Project activity has been limited this week. Unfortunately, I do not have anything of significance to show here. 

All Flipper Zero related projects have been cancelled.

### Fedora Linux
This week, I have started to look into Fedora to take place of Linux Mint on any systems currently making use of Linux Mint.

## Personal
This was a physically painful week, with the contraction of a cold that I believe was the result of sleeping in a room that was below-freezing at night [the week before](/blog/wk48_2024/).
