I have started work for Atlantic Estimating on November 1, 2022. My tasks were to assist my father with completing work.

The first location I went to was Fort Myers Beach, Florida that at the time was just hit by Hurricane Ian within the previous months. My tasks were to complete 3D scans with the Matterport Pro2 camera, creating 3D spaces that can be viewed, providing crucial details such as measurements. We stayed in Fort Myers for a week. I saw this as a major turning point in my life.

I have completed other jobs after November 2022 including those in Salisbury, Maryland and Midlothian, Virginia.

I was technically not employed by Atlantic Estimating starting some time after March 2023.
