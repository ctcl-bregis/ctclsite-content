I officially started work at 2nd Life Inc. on July 21, 2020. My first tasks were to clean Chromebooks and reinstall ChromeOS on them while recording their condition in an inventory management system. I later moved on to a variety of different system types including desktops, servers, smartphones and printers.

In 2021, I came up with a way to remove Enterprise Enrollment on Chromebooks with a method that I developed which used a IC clip that connected directly to the BIOS chip on the Chromebook motherboard. This had varying degrees of success.

In late 2022 to early 2023, I was mainly tasked with working on Apple hardware that consisted mostly of iMacs dating 1998 to 2012 and MacBooks from the same date range. It seemed that I was the only one apart from one of my supervisors had experience working on these systems.

I left 2nd Life Inc. on April 7, 2023 due to the lack of personal transportation and personal factors which were resolved throughout the rest of the year and 2024.
