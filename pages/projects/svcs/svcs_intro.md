SVCS are servers that I use for hosting various network services.

The name "SVCS" is the hostname prefix for presence on the local network. For example, a hostname would be "CTCL-SVCS1". The SVCS name was used since late 2020 from when I first started to use rack mountable servers in a home environment.

Currently, the first three systems listed here are part of the HP BladeSystem setup given to me in April 2023.
