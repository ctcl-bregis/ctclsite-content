This system is used for ancillary virtualization for services I have developed myself. As of January 7, 2025, this system is currently not in use.

This is the oldest BL460c G8 in use, with motherboard components dating to mid-2012. From June 8, 2023 to October 9, 2023, the system reported a motherboard error that was later discovered to just be the BIOS version not supporting the Intel Xeon Ivy Bridge CPUs that I attempted to install on June 8, 2023. After the original E5-2650 Sandy Bridge CPUs were installed, the system operated as normal. This configuration may be used indefinitely due to the difficulty of updating the firmware of these systems.

Specifications as of January 7, 2025:

- System: HP ProLiant BL460c G8
- CPUs: 2x Intel Xeon E5-2650
- Memory: 64GB (8x8GB) Registered ECC 4Rx4 PC3-8500 Qimonda IMHH8GP22A1F2C-10F
