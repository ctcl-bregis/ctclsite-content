"Polybutylene Terephthalate" (shorthand "PBT") is the codename given to the desktop computer system that currently serves as WBPC1 for general purpose workloads. The system is considered to be the "main PC" and almost all at-home work is done on it. It is normally used from eight (8) to fourteen (14) hours a day.

Unlike former systems which used Intel Xeon CPUs from 2010-2013, this build made use of modern components. It makes use of the ECC memory support of certain AMD Ryzen desktop CPUs and motherboards. In the past I avoided using Ryzen processors due to the uncertainty of ECC memory support. However, this time I was able to find a motherboard that I could ensure that ECC memory is supported. Others online were able to help me find out that the CPU's memory controller was configured for it with a feature within CPU-Z on Windows.

The "rebuild" of the system with the Cooler Master N200 case was mostly to make the system more portable while the motherboard was already in a microATX format. The idea to have the system more portable is from how there is the possibility of going on another long business trip or vacation. Though, bringing the desktop on trips may only be possible if traveling by road as it would be too difficult to transport the system on aircraft due to its weight and fragility. The first time it was brought with me for an extended period of time was in November 2024 with the annual trip to Syracuse, New York.

Starting January 2025, the system is no longer used for gaming as a Steam Deck took over this task along with the Windows + Linux Mint installation being replaced by Fedora Linux. This was mostly done to reduce distractions and to move from Linux Mint.
